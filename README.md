<h2>About</h2>

**Mario Worker: Community Edition** (MW: CE) is a level editor for Mario Forever, based on [Thunder Engine](https://github.com/Thunder-Engine-Dev/thunder-engine). It is a remake of Mario Worker by Buziol Games/Softendo.

The project is currently in a **PROTOTYPE** stage, with a lot of features to come. I am opening the source code of this project before the final 1.0 release for people to try it out. Everything is subject to change!

See [the forum thread about MW: CE](https://marioforever.space/topic/36/wip-mario-worker-community-edition) to learn more about what's planned, and what has been done.


<h2>Playing a PROTOTYPE build</h2>

Just pick the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/meteo-dream/mario-worker-ce/releases) tab. Currently, only Windows is shipped; Linux will be available later.

Note that creating levels in PROTOTYPE builds may and will either cause issues when playing in other builds, or they won't load at all! MW: CE is not production ready,
so a lot of breaking changes are expected throughout the PROTOTYPE stage, as well as a lot of unfinished stuff.

<h2>Building from source code</h2>

If you want to try out the latest features, experiment with the source code, or try building to another platform, here is how to do it.

1. Download [Godot Engine 4.5.x](https://godotengine.org/) (regular edition, without .NET).
2. Open a terminal in a directory where the project will be cloned to, and then clone the project to your local computer.
- If you do not have Git, [install it](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Use the following command: `git clone https://github.com/meteo-dream/mario-worker-ce --recursive`
3. Open the cloned project in Godot Engine.
- First time launch may throw errors, this is normal. Just reload the project, and it will be fine.
4. Build the game: Navigate to "Project" -> "Export..." -> Select "Windows Desktop" or create your own preset -> Click "Export Project", and uncheck the Debug checkbox (leaving it checked may slow down the game).
